In the last 30 days, this is your third high Glucose that you tagged with Carbs.</p><p>Did you tag these readings with Carbs because you ate a lot of carbs? Consider some other reasons for why you may have had high readings around this time:</p><ul><li>Has your schedule changed over the last month? Have you had less time to plan your snacks and meals, or have you changed what you’re eating, or how many carbs you’re getting at meals?</li><li>Did you eat more protein or fat than usual with your carbs? Fat can make your Glucose go up more slowly, but it can also go higher and stay higher longer. You may want to watch for a pattern of highs after certain kinds of foods or meals.</li><li>Are there any changes you can make so you get the right amount of carbs in a day and avoid highs like the ones tagged with Carbs?</li></ul>

mentorTips.highEventTagPattern.exercise.description = <p>There is an Exercise pattern among your readings. In the last 30 days, this is your third high Glucose that you tagged with Exercise.</p><p>If your Glucose goes up with exercise, it may be because your body is putting stored Glucose into your blood to make sure you have enough energy for the activity. Before you take any extra medicine, consider first waiting an hour or two to recheck your Glucose. Then you can make a decision about extra medicine if your healthcare professional has given you instructions on how to do this.</p><p>Also, if you take insulin, ask your healthcare professional if you need to check for ketones when you are over %1$@. Since your cells may have trouble taking up the Glucose from your blood to burn as energy, they might burn fat instead. This can result in high ketones. Ketones can make it harder to come back into range and can also be dangerous if they build up too much. Your healthcare professional can let you know if you need to test for ketones.</p>

mentorTips.highEventTagPattern.glucose.description = <p>There is a Glucose pattern among your readings. In the last 30 days, this is your third high Glucose that you tagged with Glucose.</p><p>Did you tag these readings with Glucose because you had too many glucose tabs or juice? Consider some other reasons for why you may have had high readings around this time:</p><ul><li>Has your schedule changed over the last month? Have you had less time to plan your snacks and meals, or have you changed what you’re eating, or how many carbs you’re getting at meals?</li><li>Did you eat more protein or fat than usual with your snacks or meals? Fat can make your Glucose go up more slowly, but it can also go higher and stay higher longer. You may want to watch for a pattern of highs after certain kinds of foods or meals.</li><li>Did you eat fast acting glucose for a low and overtreat? If this is the case, consider making a note in future readings when you take glucose so you know how much you took, and how it changed your Glucose. This way, you can refer back to these notes to help prevent overshooting.</li></ul>

mentorTips.highEventTagPattern.illness.description = <p>There is an Illness pattern among your readings. In the last 30 days, this is your third high Glucose that you tagged with an Illness.</p><p>Your body responds to illness like it responds to stress: by putting Glucose into your blood to give you more energy to cope with the illness. This extra Glucose makes you run higher even when you are not eating the same amounts or foods that you usually do. You may want to test your Glucose more often when you are sick and drink extra water to help you notice the change in your readings sooner. Ask your healthcare professional what you should do on sick days.</p>

mentorTips.highEventTagPattern.insulin.description = <p>There is an Insulin pattern among your readings. In the last 30 days, this is your third high Glucose that you tagged with Insulin.</p><p>Did you tag these readings with Insulin because you forgot to take your insulin? Have you been busier than normal? Since these highs are in a pattern, consider setting a reminder to take the insulin dose you’ve been missing.</p><p>Perhaps you tagged these readings with Insulin because you cut back your dose in order to prevent lows. Consider talking with your healthcare professional:</p><ul><li>Could your dose of medicine be causing your highs or lows?</li><li>Should your dose be changed? If so, when?</li><li>If you use insulin, should you check for ketones if your Glucose is over %1$@?</li></ul><p>Another high that can be linked to insulin is a rebound high. Most often, you will see rebound highs in the morning. You may go low in the middle of the night without realizing it. Your body feels stressed and responds by putting Glucose into your blood because it thinks this will help you deal with the situation. If you’re not sure if your high is a rebound high, consider doing some extra Glucose checks:</p><ul><li>Test before bed to make sure you aren't going to bed with a high.</li><li>Test 4 hours after you go to sleep to see what your Glucose does in the middle of the night.</li></ul>

Have you been busier than normal? Would setting a reminder to take your medicine help?</p><p>Perhaps you tagged these readings with Meds because you cut back your dose in order to prevent lows. If this is the case, consider talking with your healthcare professional:</p><ul><li>Could your dose of medicine be causing your highs or lows?</li><li>If you have been exercising regularly, or changed your diet, maybe you have noticed a change in your Glucoses. Should your medicines or doses be changed? If so, when? You may need to talk with your healthcare professional.</li></ul>

mentorTips.highEventTagPattern.mood.description = <p>There is a Mood pattern among your readings. In the last 30 days, this is your third high Glucose that you tagged with a Mood.</p><p>Just like when you are stressed, changes in your mood can cause high Glucoses. Your body puts Glucose into your blood because it thinks this will help you deal with the situation causing your mood change. While mood changes can raise or lower your Glucose, you have tagged these highs with Mood.</p><p>Sometimes, it can be more about how we cope with our mood changes than just the mood itself. In the last month:</p><ul><li>Has your day-to-day routine been the same? Are you still exercising? Are you still able to plan your snacks and meals?</li><li>Have you been drinking more alcohol than usual?</li><li>Did you remember to take your medicine, including insulin?</li></ul><p>Think about how you can plan ahead for those times when you have mood changes so you can be ready to deal with them. For example, plan to take a short walk when you have these types of mood changes to help you cope and keep your Glucose in your target range. Also, be aware of what you are eating and why: is it your usual time to eat or are you reacting to your mood?</p>

In the last 30 days, this is your third high Glucose that you tagged with Stress.</p><p>Stress can cause high Glucoses for a few reasons. Your body puts Glucose into your blood when you are stressed because it thinks this will help you deal with the stress. Also, stress can affect your normal habits. In the last month:</p><ul><li>Have you been eating more in response to your stress?</li><li>Did you eat a convenient, high-carb snack or meal because you didn’t have time to meal prep?</li><li>Have you been drinking alcohol in response to your stress?</li><li>Has your stress caused you to fall out of a routine? Are you still exercising? Are you still able to plan your snacks and meals?</li></ul><p>The good news is that you can learn to prevent the high Glucoses you may be having with stress. What causes you stress, and how can you prepare yourself to deal with it? For example, if you have a busy week ahead, then try to take extra care in meal planning for the week or plan to take a short walk each day to help you cope and keep your Glucose in your target range.

The OneTouch Reveal app is not able to confirm the source of carb measurements for entries that are imported from another app. These carb entries will not be automatically pulled into your Insulin Mentor\u2122.\n\nEntering carbs in your Insulin Mentor\u2122 to match your imported carbs may cause double carb entries. To avoid this, it may be useful to turn off the ability to import your carbs from the health app you are using.\n
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.carbs.title = Why don't I see carbs that I imported from my health app?

insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.extremeLow.title = When my meter says \
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.highAfterDose.text = Did you enter a carb number that was too low, or did you eat or drink more carbs than you expected?\nAre you stressed, ill, or not in your typical mood? All of these things can change your Glucose in an unpredictable way.\nDid you time the delivery of your insulin bolus dose according to your healthcare professional recommendations?\nDid you inject your insulin in the way your healthcare professional recommends? Do you need to rotate to a new injection location?
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.highAfterDose.title = Why is my Glucose high after taking the recommended dose?
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.lowAfterDose.asterisk = <sup>*</sup>There is one exception to this recommendation. Let's say your Glucose was low, but you had enough carbs in your calculation to cover your low. You got a \
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.lowAfterDose.text = Did you log your recent insulin dose? If not, the Insulin Mentor\u2122 cannot accurately calculate the active insulin remaining in your body.<br />Did you enter a carb number that was too high, or did you eat or drink fewer carbs than you expected?<br />Did you time taking your insulin bolus dose according to your healthcare professional recommendations especially if you had a low before eating?<br />If you took your insulin bolus after eating, did you calculate your insulin bolus using the reading from before your meal? When you calculate your bolus, use a reading that is both closest to your meal and before your meal.<sup>*</sup> Using a reading that is measured after you eat may result in a calculation that recommends more insulin than your body needs. This may cause a low Glucose.<br />Have you exercised recently? Exercise can affect your Glucose for up to 36 hours.<br />Are you stressed, ill, or not in your typical mood? All of these things can change your Glucose in an unpredictable way.<br />Did you inject how your healthcare professional recommends? Do you need to rotate to a new injection location?
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.lowAfterDose.title = Why is my Glucose low after taking the recommended dose?
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.maxDoseLimit.text = Your maximum single dose limit is set as a safety feature. Since taking too much insulin can be dangerous, your healthcare professional sets a single dose limit to help keep you safe. When your calculated dose is higher than this limit, do a recheck. Did you enter anything incorrectly? Is your Glucose higher than you expected? Consider washing your hands and rechecking it. If you find that your calculated dose is still greater than your maximum single dose limit, contact your healthcare professional for guidance.
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.maxDoseLimit.title = What if my calculated dose is greater than my maximum single dose limit?
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.missingIcon.text = You may not see one or more icons in your Insulin Mentor\u2122 because you have not entered the data that goes with an icon. First, remember that imported carbs cannot be used in your Insulin Mentor\u2122. If you are expecting to see a fork icon, and you don't, this may be why. Are you missing an active insulin icon? Remember that active insulin is only calculated when you are also using a Glucose reading in your calculation that falls outside the accepted range of your target Glucose. Also, the amount of insulin left in your body from previous bolus insulin doses may not be enough to change your recommended bolus. If this is the case, you will not see active insulin data on your graph.
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.missingIcon.title = Why am I missing an icon and its related graph information?
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.recommendedDose.text = If you have not entered carbs, and you do not have a recent enough reading, you will not see a recommended dose. Another possible reason is that you do not need more insulin. You may have enough active insulin effect left from a previous insulin bolus dose. Or, your Glucose may be below the target set by your healthcare professional and you did not enter enough carbs to need insulin. Maybe your most recent synced Glucose reading is an ##extreme high##, or <strong>##HI##</strong>, or an ##extreme low##, or <strong>##LO##</strong>. Because these readings do not have Glucose values associated with them, they cannot be used for calculations within the Insulin Mentor\u2122.
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.recommendedDose.title = Why don't I see a recommended dose?
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.unexpectedDose.text = If your recommended dose is not what you expected, double check your numbers. Did you enter everything correctly? If the recommended dose is greater than you expected, look at your Glucose. Is it higher than you expected? Consider washing your hands and rechecking it. Also consider reviewing your settings. If you are able to edit your settings, was something adjusted wrong? Maybe you have double checked everything, but you find that your recommended dose is still not what you expected. If this is the case, contact your healthcare professional for guidance.
insulinCalc.tutorial.faq.unexpectedDose.title = What if my recommended insulin dose isn't what I would expect?
insulinCalc.tutorial.finder.addEvent.text = When you log a Glucose or carb event, you can access the Insulin Mentor\u2122 from the Add an Event screen once you have entered a value.
insulinCalc.tutorial.finder.greenWords.text = The Insulin Mentor\u2122 is accessible from many locations within the OneTouch Reveal app. Keep an eye out for the green words, \
insulinCalc.tutorial.finder.insulinEvent.text = For an insulin event, access the Insulin Mentor\u2122 before entering a value.
insulinCalc.tutorial.finder.lastReading.text = If you have a Glucose reading that was taken in the last 30 minutes, you can tap \
insulinCalc.tutorial.finder.timeline.text = Access the Insulin Mentor\u2122 from Glucose events in your timeline that are no older than 30 minutes. Similarly, for carbs events, you can access the Insulin Mentor\u2122 if the entry is no older than 30 minutes. This entry must have been entered within the OneTouch Reveal app and not imported from a fitness app. Your OneTouch Reveal app cannot confirm the source of imported carb measurements. You will not be able to access the Insulin Mentor\u2122 from imported carb entries.
insulinCalc.tutorial.finder.title = Finding the Insulin Mentor\u2122
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text1 = You can enter information in the Insulin Mentor\u2122 with just a few taps.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text2 = Based on the numbers you enter, the Insulin Mentor\u2122 will recommend an insulin bolus dose. The more information you provide, the more you will see on your screen.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text3 = Use the horizon as your zero. For the area above the horizon, think \
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text4 = When the Insulin Mentor\u2122 has a Glucose reading (here, ##%1$@##) that is high enough to need insulin to cover it, the insulin needed (here, %2$@) appears above the horizon. With it, a Glucose reading icon will appear.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text5 = When you enter carbs (here, 28 g), the amount of insulin needed to cover them (here, %@) appears above the horizon. With it, a fork icon will appear.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text6 = Let's say you are using a Glucose reading in your calculation that falls outside the accepted range of your target Glucose. If you enter a recent insulin bolus dose, the calculator will be able to figure out how much insulin effect is left from that dose (if any). This (here, %1$@) will appear as a negative number below the horizon with an icon of an insulin bottle inside a body. This is your active insulin. Your recommended dose will update based on this to help prevent lows. Again, be as accurate as you can for accurate dosing recommendations.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text7 = The Insulin Mentor\u2122 combines all these numbers to come up with your calculated dose. This will appear at the right end of your horizon (here, %1$@). If your Insulin Mentor\u2122 does not need to round your calculated dose, then your calculated dose will match your recommended dose, which will appear in the middle of your graph. When your Insulin Mentor\u2122 needs to recommend a dose that works with your insulin delivery method, your recommended dose will be the rounded down version of your calculated dose.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text8 = Let's say you use an insulin pen to deliver your insulin, and that it only delivers in whole units. Since you cannot use your insulin pen to deliver your exact calculated dose (here, %1$@), your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will round this value in order to recommend a dose that you are able to deliver (here, %2$@). As you can see, when your Insulin Mentor\u2122 needs to round, it will round down for your safety, even if your calculated dose is closer to the next whole unit.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text9 = At times, there are things that affect your Glucose that cannot be included in the calculator. Some examples are exercise, mood, illness, and stress. This is why you have the ability to adjust your recommended dose by using the \
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text10 = In this example, the user wants to take %1$@ less than the recommended dose. The \
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text11 = Once you have adjusted your insulin bolus, your updated dose will appear in the middle of your graph (here, %1$@). Your calculated dose will remain at the right side of your horizon (here, %2$@).
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text12 = To record all of the information you entered, tap \u201CSave\u201D in the upper right. Your insulin bolus information will now appear in your timeline. You can always tap on this entry in your timeline to review the details of your calculation.
insulinCalc.tutorial.inAction.text13 = Be sure to keep the data in your OneTouch Reveal app up to date, and to use the Insulin Mentor\u2122 regularly.

insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.activeInsulin.example.text = Let's say your active insulin duration is four hours and you took a bolus insulin dose three hours ago. Your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will still consider part of that insulin dose as active in your body. As a result, it will lower your recommended dose if your calculation includes a Glucose value that falls outside the accepted range of your target Glucose. Now let's say you took your last bolus insulin dose five hours ago. Your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will not consider the insulin from your last dose as active in your body. That insulin will not be included in your calculation, as your active insulin is zero.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.activeInsulin.reminder.text = Your Insulin Mentor\u2122 asks, \
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.activeInsulin.text = The active insulin duration tells you how long your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will consider a previously logged insulin bolus dose as active in your body. Once that duration is up, your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will stop including the dose in calculations. Remember, this value is initially set by your healthcare professional.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.activeInsulin.title = Active Insulin Duration
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.addingSegments.text = Your healthcare professional may want some of the settings of your Insulin Mentor\u2122 to vary depending on the time of day. For your target Glucose, correction factor, and insulin-to-carb ratio, your healthcare professional can add time segments in 30-minute increments. The settings can be adjusted within each time segment. Simply tap the \
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.addingSegments.title = Adding Time Segments
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.concentration.text = Your healthcare professional will appropriately set your insulin concentration during your Insulin Mentor\u2122 activation. Discuss your questions with your healthcare professional.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.concentration.title = Insulin Concentration
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.correctionFactor.example.text = Let's say your correction factor is 1 unit:%1$@. Your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will include one unit of insulin in your calculated dose for every %2$@ your Glucose is above your target. It will subtract one unit for every %3$@ your Glucose is below your target.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.correctionFactor.text = This is also known as an insulin sensitivity factor. It is an estimate made by your healthcare professional of the effect one unit of insulin has on your Glucose.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.correctionFactor.title = Correction Factor
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.doseIncrement.text = Your healthcare professional will set your dosage increment (0.5 units or 1 unit) during your Insulin Mentor\u2122 activation. Discuss your questions with your healthcare professional.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.doseIncrement.title = Dosage Increment
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.insulinToCarb.example.text = As an example, if your insulin-to-carb unit ratio is 1:20, this means that one unit of insulin will cover 20 grams of carbs.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.insulinToCarb.text = This ratio tells you how many grams of carbs are covered with one unit of mealtime insulin.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.insulinToCarb.title = Insulin-to-Carb Ratio
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.maxDoseLimit.text = Your maximum single dose limit is set as a safety feature. Since taking too much insulin can be dangerous, your healthcare professional sets a single dose limit to help keep you safe. If your calculated dose is greater than this limit, you will be notified.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.maxDoseLimit.title = Maximum Single Dose Limit
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.subtitle = Remember: your healthcare professional enters your settings when your Insulin Mentor\u2122 is activated. Though not possible in all countries, your healthcare professional may allow you to edit your Insulin Mentor\u2122 settings. If you have questions, contact your healthcare professional before making changes.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.targetBloodGlucose.example.text = Let's say your target is %1$@ +/- %2$@. If your Glucose is greater than %3$@, your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will recommend a correction dose. If your Glucose is %4$@, it will not. Similarly, if you are below %5$@, the Insulin Mentor\u2122 will take away from your correction dose. If your Glucose is %6$@, it will not. In both situations, the goal is to get your Glucose to your target of %7$@.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.targetBloodGlucose.text = Your Insulin Mentor\u2122 aims to get your Glucose back to this target and recommends a dose based on that goal. Keep in mind that your healthcare professional may have also included a buffer zone with your target in your settings. If this is the case, your Insulin Mentor\u2122 will consider this buffer zone when it calculates a recommendation.
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.targetBloodGlucose.title = Target Glucose for Insulin Dosing
insulinCalc.tutorial.settings.title = Insulin Mentor\u2122 Settings
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.activeInsulin.text = Amount of the insulin effect from doses you already took that may still work on your Glucose\n\nLet's say you need insulin for your Glucose. If you still have active insulin effect, the Insulin Mentor\u2122 will reduce your recommended dose.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.activeInsulin.title = Active Insulin
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.adjustedDose.text = Adjusted amount of insulin based on changes you made to the recommended dose\n\nWhen you adjust your dose, you will see an additional colour on your graph, along with a plus or minus icon. If you take more insulin than what is recommended, the change you will see on your graph will be above the horizon. The icon will be a plus. If you take less insulin than what is recommended, the change you will see on your graph will be below the horizon. The icon will be a minus.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.adjustedDose.title = Adjusted Dose
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.basalBolus.text = There are two ways that insulin can be dosed to keep your Glucose in check: basal and bolus dosing. Basal insulin dosing provides a sustained, low level of insulin. Unless you are using an insulin pump, it is usually accomplished with a longer-acting insulin. This type of insulin dosing would be enough to manage your Glucose throughout the day if you did not have to take other things into consideration, like food and drink, stress, etc. This is where bolus insulin dosing can help. Insulin used in bolus dosing is usually shorter-acting. A bolus insulin dose acts quickly as a \u201Ccorrection\u201D and/or \u201Cmealtime\u201D dose. Together, basal and bolus insulin dosing can work to keep your Glucose within range.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.basalBolus.title = Basal and Bolus Insulin
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.calculatedDose.text = The sum total of insulin you need that your Insulin Mentor\u2122 has calculated based on your Glucose, carb intake, and active insulin\n\nThis number will always appear at the right side of your horizon, even if you adjust your dose.\n\nIf your recommended dose and calculated dose aren't the same, it means your Insulin Mentor\u2122 needed to round your calculated dose. It does this so it can recommend a dose that works with your insulin delivery method.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.calculatedDose.title = Calculated Dose
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.graph.text = A picture showing the data being used to calculate your recommended insulin dose\n\nThe top half of your graph shows the things that make your body need more insulin. The bottom half of your graph shows the things that tip the scale in the other direction. These things reduce your need for extra insulin.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.graph.title = Graph
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.horizon.text = When calculating an insulin dose, the horizon separates the top half of your graph from the bottom half. The top shows things that add to your body's need for more insulin. The bottom shows things that reduce your need for extra insulin.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.horizon.title = Horizon
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.insulinDoseStacking.text = Injection of another shorter-acting insulin dose before a previous dose is finished working\n\nStacking insulin doses puts you at risk for low Glucose so should be avoided. One way to help avoid insulin dose stacking is to be sure that you enter all your shorter-acting insulin doses in your app. This gives your Insulin Mentor\u2122 the chance to consider them when calculating a recommended dose.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.insulinDoseStacking.title = Insulin Dose Stacking
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.recommendedDose.text = The suggested dose of insulin to take based on the settings your healthcare professional provides and the Glucose and/or carbs you have entered\n\nThis number will appear at the center of your horizon unless you adjust the dose you deliver. If you adjust your dose, then you'll see your adjusted dose at the center of your graph.\n\nIf your recommended dose and calculated dose aren't the same, it means your Insulin Mentor\u2122 needed to round your calculated dose. It does this so it can recommend a dose that works with your insulin delivery method. When your Insulin Mentor\u2122 rounds, it always rounds down for your safety so you don't take more insulin than you need.
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.recommendedDose.title = Recommended Dose
insulinCalc.tutorial.terminology.title = Terminology
insulinCalc.tutorial.tips.activated.text = Your healthcare professional activated the Insulin Mentor\u2122 specifically for you. If your settings are editable, be sure that you and/or your healthcare professional are the only individuals who edit them.
insulinCalc.tutorial.tips.activated.title = Your Insulin Mentor\u2122 Was Activated Only for You
insulinCalc.tutorial.tips.duplicate.text = Remember, carbs that are imported from a different app cannot be used in your Insulin Mentor\u2122. Entering carbs in your Insulin Mentor\u2122 to match these imported carbs may cause duplicate carb entries. To avoid this, it may be useful to turn off the ability to import your carbs from the health app you are using.
insulinCalc.tutorial.tips.duplicate.title = Duplicating Imported Carb Entries
insulinCalc.tutorial.tips.edit.text = Perhaps you took more or less insulin than your saved calculation reads. If this is the case, you should edit your insulin bolus dose entry in your timeline so it matches what you delivered. This helps with the accuracy of your active insulin and thus, can help avoid stacking and prevent lows.\n\nTo edit a logged insulin bolus dose calculation, tap the event in your timeline. You will be taken to the graph you saw when you saved the entry originally. Tap the \

Are you worried about losing your entry from your timeline? This will only happen if it was added inside the Insulin Mentor\u2122 and you removed it before saving your calculation.
insulinCalc.tutorial.tips.remove.title = Remove a Reading or Carb Entry from Your Calculation
insulinCalc.tutorial.tips.stacking.text = Be sure to log any recent bolus insulin doses that you took without using the Insulin Mentor\u2122. Active insulin takes into account recent bolus insulin doses. Recording any unlogged insulin doses helps with the accuracy of your active insulin. This, in turn, helps with the accuracy of your recommended dose. Overall, this helps prevent lows.\n\nAlso, note that the combination of backing out of your bolus insulin dose calculation before saving plus taking the recommended dose anyway, will cause stacking. This may cause a low and may also make your next recommended dose less accurate.
